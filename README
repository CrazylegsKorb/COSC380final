drink-search uses three arguments to search through a database of drinks

arguments to use:
--in=""             - searches and returns drinks that use a given ingredient
--id=""             - searches and returns a drink that has a specific drink ID
--name=""           - searches and returns the first drink that matches the given name
--rand=boolean      - returns a random drink
--alco=boolean      - returns alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks

no more than one argument can be used at a time!
some drinks in the database have weird values stored for ingredients and measurements, this can be reflected on the website for the database:
